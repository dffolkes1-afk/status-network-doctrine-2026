Status Network is a vertically integrated digital infrastructure designed to deliver high-tier computing, identity, and entertainment access to the lowest economic level without luxury hardware dependency.

It replaces centralized platforms, premium device lock-in, and extractive social models with a device-agnostic, ad-subsidized, AI-native system embedded directly into residential and commercial spaces.

This repository defines what Status is allowed to be.

It contains no experimental code.
